mobile_industry_article=""" 30 Major mobile phone brands Compete in India – A Case Study of Success and Failures
Is the Indian mobile market a terrible War Zone? We have more than 30 brands competing with each other. Let’s find out some insights about the world second-largest mobile bazaar.There is a massive invasion by Chinese mobile brands in India in the last four years. Some of the brands have been able to make a mark while others like Meizu, Coolpad, ZTE, and LeEco are a failure.On one side, there are brands like Sony or HTC that have quit from the Indian market on the other side we have new brands like Realme or iQOO entering the marketing in recent months.The mobile market is so competitive that some of the brands like Micromax, which had over 18% share back in 2014, now have less than 5%. Even the market leader Samsung with a 34% market share in 2014, now has a 21% share whereas Xiaomi has become a market leader. The battle is fierce and to sustain and scale-up is going to be very difficult for any new entrant.new comers in Indian Mobile MarketiQOO –They have recently (March 2020) launched the iQOO 3 in India with its first 5G phone – iQOO 3. The new brand is part of the Vivo or the BBK electronics group that also owns several other brands like Oppo, Oneplus and Realme.Realme – Realme launched the first-ever phone – Realme 1 in November 2018 and has quickly became a popular brand in India. The brand is one of the highest sellers in online space and even reached a 16% market share threatening Xiaomi’s dominance.iVoomi – In 2017, we have seen the entry of some new Chinese mobile brands likeiVoomi which focuses on the sub 10k price range, and is a popular online player. They have an association with Flipkart.Techno &amp; Infinix – Transsion Group’s Tecno and Infinix brands debuted in India in mid-2017 and are focusing on the low end and mid-range phones in the price range of Rs. 5000 to Rs. 12000.10.OR &amp; Lephone – 10.OR has a partnership with Amazon India and is an exclusive online brand with phones like 10.OR D, G and E. However, the brand is not very aggressive currently.Kult – Kult is another player who launched a very aggressively priced Kult Beyond mobile in 2017 and followed up by launching 2-3 more models.However, most of these new brands are finding it difficult to strengthen their footing in India. As big brands like Xiaomi leave no stone unturned to make things difficult.Also, it is worth noting that there is less Chinese players coming to India now. As either all the big brands have already set shop or burnt their hands and retreated to the homeland China.Chinese/ Global  Brands Which failed or are at the Verge of Failing in India?
There are a lot more failures in the market than the success stories. Let’s first look at the failures and then we will also discuss why some brands were able to succeed in India.HTC – The biggest surprise this year for me was the failure of HTC in India. The brand has been in the country for many years, in fact, they were the first brand to launch Android mobiles. Finally HTC decided to call it a day in July 2018.LeEco – LeEco looked promising and even threatening to Xiaomi when it came to India. The company launched a series of new phones and smart TVs at affordable rates. Unfortunately, poor financial planning back home caused the brand to fail in India too.LG – The company seems to have lost focus and are doing poorly in all segments. While the budget and mid-range offering are uncompetitive, the high-end models are not preferred by buyers.Sony – Absurd pricing and lack of ability to understand the Indian buyers have caused Sony to shrink mobile operations in India. In the last 2 years, there are far fewer launches and hardly any promotions or hype around the new products.Meizu – Meizu is also a struggling brand in India and is going nowhere with the current strategy. There are hardly any popular mobiles nor a retail presence.ZTE – The company was aggressive till last year with several new phones launching under the Nubia banner, but with recent issues in the US, they have even lost the plot in India.Coolpad – I still remember the first meeting with Coolpad CEO in Mumbai when the brand started operations. There were big dreams and ambitions, but the company has not been able to deliver and keep up with the rivals in the last 1 year.Gionee – Gionee was doing well in the retail, but the infighting in the company and loss of focus from the Chinese parent company has made it a failure. The company is planning a comeback. However, we will have to wait and see when that happens."""
mobile_industry_article="I have had the ring doorbell for years now and it seemed quite natural that I would migrate to a Ring Alarm System. I did. I left ADT and decided upon such as it integrated well with that was already in place. I really prefer the self monitoring and the idea that it’s at such a low cost... $8.50/mthly. I love the ease of installation too. Did it myself and quick too."
mobile_industry_article="I recently updated to this system from an older DVR still swann system. I figured I could upgrade just the cameras and DVR since my original 8 camera system that was installed 5 years ago was BNC cable. First of all, swann is a excellent brand, however it’s older models DVR suffer from poor app supposed for the the iPhone. Customer service is pretty good, takes a while to get them on but they’re very helpful. This new model has a newer app the “swann security” app and it’s a whole lots faster with the substream so you get very little lag once you fire up the app on the iPhone and start streaming live video. Since this camera has both a LED light and sirens it’s cool that the live stream works quick because the whole point of having the light/siren is to be able to activate it when I want. So through the app there’s a light/siren activator button, however, at home on the actual DVR system the menu does NOT have an option to activate alarm/light at will, you would have to program the system to do it which doesn’t make sense to have the siren/light option and not being able to active from the DVR itself. The 2TB HD and new DVR menus are much friendly than the older systems def worth the upgrade from 1080p cameras to this one."
